# Conway Game of Life

This project is an implementation of the famous cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game is built using React and Next.js 14.

- Experience the classic Conway Game of Life on your web browser.
- Watch as cells evolve based on simple rules and create mesmerizing patterns.

## Features

- **Start Button:** Initiate or resume the simulation to observe the cells evolve over time.
- **Reset Button:** Clear the board and start a new simulation.
- **Idle Button:** Turn on automatic simulation mode and see the simulation unfold itself.

### Rules

The Conway Game of Life follows a few simple rules:

1. **Underpopulation:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2. **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
3. **Overpopulation:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4. **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
